# **Build a CRUD Demo using Spring REST**

An example in which I show the usage of Spring REST and Hibernate

It's a simple web customer tracker in which I do CRUD operations in a mysql Database using REST.

The Spring Configuration is done in pure Java (no XML)


Note: There is a sql-script folder to create the schemas and the tables.
